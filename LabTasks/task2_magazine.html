      <p>
        Modern design is about simplicity and clarity. The beauty of minimalism lies in its ability
        to focus on essentials, removing unnecessary clutter. Designers today are inspired by the
        harmony between color, space, and typography.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of design continues to evolve as technology influences creativity. Floating layouts,
        flexible grids, and responsive designs define how we experience visual content.

      <h2>Photography & Emotion</h2>

      <p>
        Great photography captures emotions, not just scenes. It tells a story that resonates
        with the viewer. From portraits to landscapes, every frame has the potential to express
        feelings that words cannot convey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s light, shadows, or colors — every element adds depth and texture to the story
        behind each photograph.
